    <h2>Restaurant taste at home</h2>
    <p>These made from scratch, Garlic Butter Cheddar Biscuits are the perfect side dish for any meal, whether you're having a bowl soup, 
        chili, or stew. They taste buttery, with lots of cheese and garlic flavor, and flaky layers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cold salted whipped butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup 0% fat Greek Yogurt</li>
            <li>4 cloves minced or grated garlic, divided</li>
            <li>2 ounces shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>olive oil spray</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375F. Line a sheet pan with a silicone mat for best results and adjust the rack on the top third of the oven.</li>
            <li>Combine dry ingredients with a fork. Cut 2 tablespoons of the butter in with a pastry knife for best results or 2 forks if you don't have one, until no longer visible.</li>
            <li>Add the yogurt, cheddar, half the garlic and mix with a fork.</li>
            <li>Using your hands knead the dough at least 20 times until it holds together and becomes tacky and smooth.* Form it into a flat ball and cut into 8 equal pieces. Roll each into a ball, then place it on the prepared baking sheet, , slightly flattened 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Spray biscuits with oil and bake on the top rack about 20 to 24 minutes or until golden, no need to turn. Once done, let them rest 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter in a small frying pan, add the remaining garlic and saute on low heat about 1 minute until fragrant. When the biscuits are ready, brush them with the melted garlic butter and top with parsley.</li>
        </ol>
