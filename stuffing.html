    <h2>Stuffing so good it will become a staple</h2>
    <p>Thanksgiving dinner is one of those occassions when people pull out all of the stops. This version of stuffing (or dressing if you prefer)
        is a show-stopper. If you make it once, prepare for it to become a necessary side on Thanksgiving and one of the few dishes you make outside of the
        holiday as well.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter</li>
            <li>8 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
            <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 celery stalks, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>2 (7.4-ounce) jars roasted peeled whole chestnuts, coarsely broken (this is optional and can be removed if there are allergies)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves</li>
            <li>1 pound day-old ciabatta bread, cut into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
            <li>2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>1 cup (or more) canned low-salt chicken broth</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten to blend</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Butter a 15 by 10 by 2-inch glass baking dish. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and saute until crisp and golden, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a large bowl. </li>
            <li>Melt the remaining butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, rosemary, and garlic. Saute until the onions are very tender, about 12 minutes. </li>
            <li>Gently stir in the chestnuts and parsley. Transfer the onion mixture to the large bowl with the pancetta.</li>
            <li>Add the bread and Parmesan and toss to coat. Add enough broth to the stuffing mixture to moisten. Season the stuffing, to taste, with salt and pepper. Mix in the eggs.</li>
            <li>Transfer the stuffing to the prepared dish. Cover with buttered foil, buttered side down, and bake until the stuffing is heated through, about 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until the top is crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.</li>
        </ol>
